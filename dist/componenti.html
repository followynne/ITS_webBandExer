        <h4>Billy Corgan - FrontMan</h4>
        <img src="/BilCor.e0a6b8d6.jpg" class="imgMember">
        <h5>Biography</h5>
            <div class="member">William Patrick Corgan Jr. was born to Bill Corgan and Martha Corgan on March 17, 1967, St. Patricks Day. He was born in Chicago, his father being a blues musician and his mother a flight attendant. Billy grew to be a "four-track-cassette making geek" who played guitar in his spare time while working at an old record store and then at a pizza place as a delivery boy. He played guitar up in his bedroom, learning scales and progressions. 

                    In high school in 1985, Billy formed a band called Hexen. YouTube has videos of 4 of their songs, a guitar solo, and a guitar/bass duet. Billy also had a band called Coat of Eyes with Greg Bates, with at least 1 tape full of songs. After meeting Ron Roesing and Dale Meiners, he renamed his band The Marked, since both Billy and Ron had large birthmarks. They moved to Florida, minus Greg, who was still in high school, as Chicago had "too many goth bands" at the time. The Marked had little success, so they broke up and Billy moved back to Chicago and lived with his father. 
                    
                    In Chicago, Billy met James Iha, which started the basis for the Smashing Pumpkins. The two played their first show as The Smashing Pumpkins in July, 1988, with James on guitar, Billy on bass, and a drum machine. Billy then met D'arcy, who joined on bass. One of their shows was seen by Metro owner Joe Shanahan, who said he'd book them if they hired a real drummer, so they found and hired Jimmy Chamberlin, and the band was complete. 
                    
                    After the Pumpkins split in 2000, Billy wasted little time before forming Zwan with former Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and 3 other members. Zwan released only 1 album before disbanding, after which Billy worked on a solo album. Surprisingly, though, on the date of his solo album's release, Billy put out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune, publicly stating that he wanted to work again under The Smashing Pumpkins. 2 years later, the band would re-form with Billy and Jimmy, and new members Jeff Schroeder (guitar), Ginger Reyes (bass) and Lisa Harriton (keyboards). After finishing their tours for Zeitgeist, the first album since the breakup, Ginger, Lisa and Jimmy departed, and Nicole Fiorentino was brought in on bass, and then-19-yr-old Mike Byrne on drums. As of 2014, Billy is recording 2 new albums primarily with Jeff in the studio, and guest drummer Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe. 
                    
                    Other than the Pumpkins, Billy has acted as co-writer, producer, and guest musician for a large number of bands, including the Frogs, Hole, Marylin Manson, Tommy Iommi (Black Sabbath), Lisa Marie Presley, Scorpions, etc. He has appeared on several soundtracks as a solo artist, including "Ransom" and "Stigmata". Billy has been known to credit John Lennon, Judas Priest, David Bowie, Blondie, the Cure, and My Bloody Valentine as musical inspirations. He also takes an interest in the music of Radiohead, Spiritualized, the Frogs, and Garbage. In the early 21st century, Billy branched out further by writing a book of poetry, founding a pro wrestling company, and opening a tea house.

        <h4>James Iha - Guitarist</h4>
        <img src="/JamIha.8f9c08ed.jpg" class="imgMember">
        <h5>Biography</h5>
            <div class="member">James Yoshinobu Iha was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 26, 1968. He has been in several bands before the Pumpkins, including the Feds, and Snake Train. He met Billy Corgan in 1988 and proceeded to form the roots of the band we now know as the Smashing Pumpkins. Together, the two wrote "goth-pop" songs and played with a drum machine at several bars in the Chicago area. James is usually considered the "quiet one", although in concert he has been known to taunt the crowd with strings of obscenities, perform ad-lib rap, and tap dance. James and Billy share the lead guitar and rhythm guitar duties live, although he hasn't always been so involved in the lead guitar side of the music. James writes the occaisional song for the Smashing Pumpkins, with credits on Mayonaise, Soma, and I Am One. James has numerous songs released as b-sides, and a solo album in February of 1998 titled "Let It Come Down". 

                    James is very quiet and usually very sarcastic. He has had a variety of hairstyles over the years, from shoulder-length black with blonde streaks to short blonde hair. He also modeled for Anna Sui in 1996. James is a co-owner of Scratchie Records with D'arcy Wretzky which began in 1996 and has signed bands such as Fulflej, Fountains of Wayne, and the Frogs. 
                    
                    After the Pumpkins split in 2000, James went on to do fashion and soundtrack work in Japan, as well as numerous collaborations with other artists, often from his New York apartment studio (see the discography's side projects for more info).

        <h4>Jimmy Chamberlin - Drummer</h4>
        <img src="/JimCha.d857fef4.jpg" class="imgMember">
        <h5>Biography</h5>
        <div class="member">Jimmy Chamberlin was born on June 10 1964 in Joliet, Illinois. His brother was a jazz drummer, as was his father. Jimmy also took up drumming, and before playing in the Smashing Pumpkins, he played in several jazz bands, such as JP and the Cats, and Eddie Karosa's Polka Party. Billy hired him to play with the Smashing Pumpkins in 1988 when the band opened for Jane's Addiction. Jimmy had never really listened to rock, but was really impressed by the intensity of Billy's music. He was hired permanently. 

            Then in July of 1996 in New York City, he and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin. Jonathan died, and Jimmy was arrested for possession of heroin. Billy, James, and D'arcy promptly booted Chamberlin from the band, as he had been battling a continual drug problem. 
                    
            Chamberlin entered drug rehab. When he finished, he joined the Last Hard Men, who recorded a cover of Alice Cooper's "School's Out" for the Scream soundtrack. The Last Hard Men consists of Kelley Deal, Sebastien Bach, and Jimmy Flemion. 
                    
            Then, in February of 1999, Billy and Jimmy met for lunch. The two resolved their differences and put their past behind them. Jimmy Chamberlin was rehired as drummer for the Smashing Pumpkins, and subsequently played on the Arising! Tour, "Machina: the Machines of God", and the tour in support of that album. 
                    
            After the Pumpkins split in 2000, Jimmy joined Billy's new band, Zwan. Zwan, however, was short-lived, and broke up after only a single album, despite Billy having written a large amount of material. In 2005, while Billy was doing his own solo album, Jimmy put out an album with his fusion band The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. 
                    
            In 2007, when The Smashing Pumpkins re-formed, Jimmy was on board once again, and stuck with the band for their first new album, Zeitgeist, and supporting tours. On March 20, 2009, Jimmy once again left the Pumpkins, stating in a blog entry, "I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don’t fully possess." 
                    
            After his departure from the Pumpkins, Jimmy formed a new band, initially called This, but later renamed to Skysaw when another band already called This was discovered. Their first and only album was released in June 2011. Since then, Jimmy has done drum workshops, recorded and played with saxophonist Frank Catalano, and in 2013 became CEO of LiveOne Inc, a digital/streaming entertainment company.

        <h4>D'arcy Wretzky - Bassist</h4>
        <img src="/DArcy.d74cff11.jpg" class="imgMember">
        <h5>Biography</h5>
        <div class="member">D'arcy Elizabeth Wretzky (formerly Wretzky-Brown) was born on May 1, 1968 in Michigan, USA. Little is known about her childhood except that she had two sisters, one of whom is on the cover of the "Today" CD single. D'arcy has formal training on the oboe, but none on bass guitar, which she plays for the Smashing Pumpkins. As is stated in the biography for Billy Corgan, she met him outside a club in 1988, and joined the band a few days later. She then left for Germany, and called Billy when she returned, as he was still looking for a bassist. D'arcy had little training on bass. Billy liked her personality and attitude, which got her into the band. D'arcy also acts as background vocals for live performances, and has sung a few songs as lead vocals such as "Daydream", the cover of Blondie's "Dreamin'", and a verse with Jimmy Chamberlin on "Farewell & Goodnight". 

            D'arcy co-owns Scratchie Records with James Iha, among others. She enjoys listening to Air, Luscious Jackson, Beastie Boys, Nirvana, the Beatles, Red Red Meat, Chainsaw Kittens, and Catherine. She was married to Kerry Brown, drummer for Catherine, and also occasional drummer and producer for Smashing Pumpkins. 
                
            On September 9, 1999 after 10 years of service to the band, D'Arcy left the Smashing Pumpkins. D'Arcy did, however, play on the Pumpkins last record, "Machina: the Machines of God". Her position behind the bass guitar was taken by Melissa Auf der Maur for the upcoming tour. There was no public statement as to the reason for her departure, although she was arrested for drug possession shortly afterward. 
                
            When the band reformed in 2007, D'Arcy was not a part of it, and has had little media coverage since she left the band, aside from an impromptu Q101 phone interview in July 2009, during which she stated she wasn't healthy enough to be a musician, and an arrest for missing 4 court dates related to failure to control her horses.
